## Advanced C

The course gives in-depth understanding of logic behind C language. Participants would understand how commands written in C are mapped to processor instructions, memory handling, pointers and function callbacks and more advanced C constructs. Finally, the course gives practical pointers on how C programs are optimized and applied in a specific embedded environments.

Topics:

C data types, arrays vs pointers, casting, little vs big endian
Declarations, variables, storage classes, types, constants, static and automatic duration, memory locations, linkage
Function caveats, calling conventions, calling from assembly
Pointer arithmetic, multi-dimensional arrays, function pointers, void pointers, endianness
Input-output and I/O dangers
Strings and safe string handling in C, structures, member alignment and padding
Splitting a program, declaration sharing, header files
Build process and tools, preprocessor, compiler, linker, scripting
Memory handling, buffers, queues, lists, double buffering
Cross-compilation, embedded targets, compiler specifics
